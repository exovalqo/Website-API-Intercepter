# Website API Intercepter (Utilizes Fiddler API's)
**Intercept URL's and changes (respose header and/or body) and (request header and/or body)**  

What I Learned:  
- I learned the structure of GET/POST request/response  
- Practice with C# Language and Fiddler's API

**Practical Uses:**  
There are multiple uses for this tool. I will list the most common.  
1. Automated response packet change (This can bypass unencrypted API calls)  
2. Automated request packet change
